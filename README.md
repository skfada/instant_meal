# Instant Meal
    The Instant Meal is a team work project demo with respect to our learning in ALX Africa.

    we are using this project to demonstrate what we have learnt so far with respect to software engineering in solving real world problems for people who are so occupied with activities that they do not have time to prepare meal for themselves.

    The application also, will assist restaurant owners with respect of their online presence, thereby reaching more customers in order to generate more revenue as they meet the expectations of their online customers via the Instant Meal application

    The Instant Meal will serve as a market place for restaurant Owners and for various users to sell and buy their prepared meals at a competative delivery time frame respectfully.
